  "bio": {
    "title": "A Bit About Me",
    "content": "I began my journey @years years ago as a junior front-end engineer for a small design company building ColdFusion websites for construction companies. Today, I lead the front-end efforts for one of America's largest insurance companies, working with technologies such as React, Redux and Node.js.|Throughout my career, I've seen the Web grow from simple static HTML websites into complex data-driven Progressive Web Apps. Over the years, I've invested countless hours honing my skills to stay on top of the next emerging technology trend. I'm not an expert at everything out there, but I'd be confident building just about anything UI related."

Alan is the kind of front-end developer UX designers like myself dream of: Can work directly out of Photoshop comps, leveraging all assets therein with zero confusion, follows wire-frames to the letter, focuses like a laser on delivering high-quality front-end code that is virtually indistinguishable from the comp he was handed and does all of this at lightning speed. It was typical for me to send him a Photoshop comp on Tuesday and think he was merely reviewing it when I passed his cubicle on Wednesday when in fact he had already turned the comp in to code -- using CSS to mirror much of the imagery that appeared in the comp. The guy's a killer. If you're smart, you'll put him in charge of your whole front-end team."
